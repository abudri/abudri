- 👋 Hi, I’m @abudri
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Ruby, Rails, Terraform, AWS, DevOps and learning in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently professionally building out, supporting and deploying application infrastructure used by millions, utilizing Terraform, AWS, Docker, Jenkins, GitHub, and monitoring with New Relic.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, as able, in between work and learning. I love Ruby for Good.
